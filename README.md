# Speech-Detection-and-Diarization
Speech detection and diarization are essential techniques in audio processing that aim to identify when speech occurs and distinguish between different speakers in an audio recording. These techniques are widely used in industries such as telecommu- nications, media, healthcare, and customer service to enhance the analysis of con- versations, meetings, and interviews. This project presents a fully integrated system that enables users to upload an audio file, automatically detect speech segments, and separate them based on speaker identities. 
The core functionality is built around Pyannote’s pre-trained speaker diarization model, which is known for its robust performance in accurately identifying and seg- menting multiple speakers. Once the audio is uploaded, the system processes it by extracting speech segments corresponding to individual speakers. These segments are then uploaded to Cloudinary, a cloud storage platform, where each speaker’s audio file is stored and made accessible via a unique URL. The system’s frontend is de- signed to be simple, intuitive, and user-friendly. Users interact with the application through a web interface where they can upload audio files and view the processed results in a tabular format. Each row of the table represents a different speaker, while the columns display the speaker’s identifier and a clickable link to the corresponding audio file hosted on Cloudinary. This ensures easy access to the segmented audio files for review, download, or further processing. On the backend, the Flask web frame-work handles file uploads, model execution, and integration with Cloudinary. The uploaded audio is processed asynchronously, allowing the system to handle multiple requests efficiently. The audio processing involves segmenting speech using diarization techniques and converting the segments into separate audio files. These files are then securely uploaded to Cloudinary, ensuring scalability and accessibility. This project has numerous practical applications. It can be used in transcription services to sim- plify the task of separating different speakers’ contributions, making it invaluable for meeting minutes, podcast production, and interviews. In call centers, it can analyze customer-agent interactions to improve service quality and customer satisfaction. Re- searchers can use it to study conversational dynamics, such as speaker dominance and turn-taking. In summary, this speech detection and diarization project combines state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with cloud integration and a responsive web interface to deliver a seamless, scalable solution for speaker identification and segmentation. It automates a traditionally labor-intensive process, making it faster, more efficient, and accessible to various industries that rely on audio analysis.
