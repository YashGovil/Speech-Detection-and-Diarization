[0s - 30s]: Hey, hi, I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. How about you? Yes, I went through them yesterday. The progress looks great so far. I noticed a few areas where we could improve the user interface. What do you think? That's a great idea. I'll work on that. Also, I wanted to ask if you've received the feedback from the client about the latest prototype. Got it. I'll tweak that. I can start implementing the changes tomorrow. Do you want me to send you the revised version for feedback? Not much. Just working on the final testing for the current
[30s - 36s]: But I should be good to help with the changes once I'm done with that. Absolutely. Thanks for the quick sing today.
