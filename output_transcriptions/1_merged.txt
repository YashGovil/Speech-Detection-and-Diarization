[0s - 30s]: Good to see you. How have you been? I'm good too. Just a bit busy with work. Have you had a chance to look at the new project updates? I agree. I was thinking we could streamline the design a bit more, maybe make the navigation a bit simpler and improve the responsiveness for mobile users. Yes, I did. They're happy with most of it, but they want some adjustments in the color scheme and typography. They want something a bit more modern. That would be great. I'll review it and get back to you by the end of the day.
[30s - 39s]: Anything else on your plate for this week? Sounds perfect. Let's catch up again in a couple of days to make sure we're on track. No problem, take care and talk soon.
